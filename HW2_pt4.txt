In short, all I did was vectorize the two for loops, which decreased the time running in R from about 10 seconds to near instantaneous. 
This is backed up by the output from sbatch which indicates we went from about 7 seconds of run time down to .2 seconds just by vectorizing the for loop process. 
It got so low that sbatch couldn't even recognize which objects were taking up the most time because each part was taking up so little time. 

P.S. I confirmed with other students that you had indicated that even though the initial time wasn't over 30 seconds, 
it would be fine as long as it was a noticeable difference in the speed at which the code ran. 
I'd say a decrease of 350 times is a pretty noticeable improvement.
