My code is comprised of two for loops: 
one simulates a single round of golf while the second simulates this process 10,000 times to report the 
average course par, average total strokes, and average strokes relative to par. 
In the round for loop, we sample to choose a par for the hole and a score for the hole based on a probs argument, and then
a scorecard is created to represent the totality of the round.
Finally, this process is repeated 10,000 times and then averages mentioned above are all reported.
